# Diabetes Prediction Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict diabetes outcomes using machine learning models. The dataset includes clinical and demographic features such as Age, BMI, Glucose levels, Insulin, Pregnancies, and Diabetes Pedigree Function. Before training, the data was carefully **handled for missing values and outliers** to ensure high-quality input for the models.

## Dataset
- Source: Local dataset (e.g., Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset)
- Number of features: 8 original features + engineered features
- Number of samples: Variable (training/testing)
- Feature handling:
  - Missing values were imputed.
  - Outliers were detected and treated.
  - Feature scaling (StandardScaler) and log transformation applied to skewed features.
  - Additional engineered features created:
    - `Glucose_BMI` = Glucose ร BMI
    - `Pregnancy_per_Age` = Pregnancies รท Age
    - `Glucose_Insulin_ratio` = Glucose รท Insulin
  - Dummy encoding for age groups (`Young`, `Middle`, `Old`) and BMI groups (`Underweight`, `Normal`, `Overweight`, `Obese`)

## Project Steps

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Impute missing values.
- Detect and handle outliers.
- Apply log transformation to skewed features (`Pregnancies`, `Age`, `Insulin`, `DiabetesPedigreeFunction`).
- Scale all features using StandardScaler.
- Create engineered features and dummy variables as described above.

### 2. Train-Test Split
- Split dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
- Stratified splitting to maintain class distribution.

### 3. Model Training
- Models trained:
  1. Logistic Regression
  2. SVM (RBF)
  3. Random Forest
  4. XGBoost
- Hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV or GridSearchCV.
- SMOTE used in pipelines to handle class imbalance.
- Pipelines include preprocessing steps to ensure transformations are applied consistently.

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Metrics computed:
  - Accuracy
  - ROC-AUC
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score for each class
- Train accuracy also checked to monitor overfitting.

| Model                | Train Accuracy | Test Accuracy | ROC-AUC |
|---------------------|---------------|---------------|---------|
| Logistic Regression  | 0.839         | 0.779         | 0.869   |
| SVM (RBF)            | 0.896         | 0.864         | 0.912   |
| Random Forest        | 0.985         | 0.870         | 0.944   |
| XGBoost              | 0.928         | 0.883         | 0.955   |

### 5. Threshold Optimization (for XGBoost)
- Best F1-score threshold found: 0.64
- Adjusted predictions improve balance between Precision and Recall.
- Example metrics at threshold 0.64:

| Class | Precision | Recall | F1-score |
|-------|-----------|--------|----------|
| 0     | 0.91      | 0.93   | 0.92     |
| 1     | 0.87      | 0.83   | 0.85     |
| Accuracy | 0.90 |        |          |

### 6. Model Deployment
- XGBoost model wrapped in a custom class to include threshold for predictions.
- Model saved with pickle for deployment in Streamlit or other applications.
- Streamlit app can take new patient data as input and output predicted diabetes outcome and probability.
